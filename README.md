## Concept

Twitter like landing page with HTML, CSS and JS

## Statement of Requirements

For this session, you are simply required to have an HTML & CSS web page ready to be used for the project. The page should include:

-   A tweet submission form containing:

    -   A field to enter a username (limited to 16 characters).
    -   A field to enter a message (limited to 256 characters).
    -   A button to validate and send the tweet.

-   An area to display received tweets:

    -   You will use either grid or flexbox as the positioning system in HTML.
    -   There will be a container composed of elements. Each child element of the container will represent a tweet.
    -   Child elements will be displayed in chronological order (most recent at the beginning).
    -   Each tweet should display the message and the username of its author.


## Going Further

You can also look ahead in the project by including the HTML & CSS for the following features (this part is optional and can be done later):

-   A system to display the most commonly used words.
-   A system to add/remove a "like."
    An area to display tweets that have received the most "likes."
-   A way to highlight tweets from the most active authors.
-   A space to display the avatar of a tweet's author.
-   A system for commenting and viewing the list of comments on a tweet.
-   A set of tools for user authentication.
